=========================
NSD Term Project Proposal
=========================

The proposal is to help you practice writing a specification.  It should
include the following contents:

1. Basic information (including the GitHub repository)
2. Problem to solve
3. Perspective users
4. System architecture
5. API description
6. Engineering infrastructure
7. Schedule

The purpose of a proposal (or a specification) is to enable discussions that
cannot be done with programming language.  For example, source code is not
suitable for describing software architecture.  In `*The Architecture of Open
Source Applications* <https://aosabook.org/en/index.html>`__, you can see the
many different ways that the developers use to present architecture.  There is
not a fixed way to do it, but the natural language and diagrams are the most
common tools to do it.  They are probably the most effective ones, too.

I will assume you to implement the project according to your proposal, and help
you control the progress as much as I can.  You may change the plan anytime.
But you are expected to keep me posted, so that I may not lose track of your
project, and can rigorously assess its quality in your presentation at the end
of the semester.

The proposal accounts for 8 points out of the 40 points allocated to the term
project.  Like homework, you will need to create a PR against the ``proposal``
branch (not ``master``).  You need to create a sub-directory using exactly your
GitHub username as your working directory (``nsdhw_20sp/proposal/$username/``).
The hierarchy should be like::

  - nsdhw_20sp (<- repository root)
    - proposal
      - username (<- your working directory)
        - Files for your proposal

There is a template (``template.rst``) provided to help you get started.  It
contains additional information about how to write the proposal.  It is up to
you to use it or use your own format.
